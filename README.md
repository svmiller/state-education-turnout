state-education-turnout
=======================

This R script provides an illustration of using R to answer questions similar to what Pollock (2012) did in his book. It's intended for my handsome students in POSC 3410 at Clemson University. For our purpose, did state voter turnout vary as a function of a state's collective level of educational attainment? The author used Census data from 2000 and voter turnout data from 2006 to answer that question. We will use turnout data from the 2012 Presidential election with educational attainment data from 2009 (easiest I could find).

We will also use the U.S. Census regional data. Data sources follow:
- http://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/maps/pdfs/reference/us_regdiv.pdf for the U.S. Census' understanding of regions.
- https://www.census.gov/prod/2012pubs/p20-566.pdf for educational attainment data.
- http://elections.gmu.edu/Turnout_2012G.html for turnout data, naturally
